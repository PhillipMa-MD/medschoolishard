# Medical School is Hard

This is the repo for the project outlined [here](https://www.philma.me/projects/4vhutpxpljfy38pwia7ba0sr5e1afn)

Did you know that medical school was hard?

Here be some 'helpful' scripts that I used to 'Topic Model'

I'm still working on finding where I sourced most of this, but here's a start:

1. Most of the reddit scraping I pulled from a reddit comment which I cannot for the life of me find anymore. It was originally made to download the entire post history of a particular username, but I retooled it slightly to download an entire subreddit. I almost certainly got it from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/)

2. Pretty much all of the Topic Modeling stuff came from [This Medium Article](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluate-topic-model-in-python-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-7d57484bb5d0)
